	A smile is intenti0nal and might inde ed indi cate happine ss, just as a fu rr0wed br0w might be pr00f 0f a melanch0lic temperam ent. But we als 0 kn0w that em0t i0n is fleeting and can be fa ked. We thus shouldn’t really trust whatever it is a ph0t0graphic p0rtrait seems t0 be telling us. A p0r trait is an 0pen d00r. It can re mind us 0f 0ur ethical duty t0 the 0ther. Unlike ma chines, we see with sympa thy.

	One 0f the mos t exci ting fin dings t0 emer  ge fr0m neur oscience in recent years underl ines the brain’s inherently s0cial nature. Neur0scie ntists have l0ked m0re cl0sely at what the brain d0es during n0n-active m0me nts, when we’re chil ling 0ut and the bra in is at rest. Every time we are n0t eng aged in an active task the brai n falls int0 a neural c0nf igurati0n called the “default netw0rk.” The defa ult netw0r k directs us t0 think ab0ut 0ther pe0ple’s minds—their th0u ghts, feelin gs, and g0als. Whenever it has a free moment, the human brain has an aut0ma tic reflex t0 g0 s0cial.
	But 0ve r the last fifty years, while s0ciety has been gr0wing m0re and m0re pr0sper 0us and indivi dualistic, 0ur s0cial c0nnecti0ns have been diss0lving. We v0lunteer less. We entertain guests at 0ur h0mes less. We are getting married less. We are havi ng few er child ren. And we have fewer and fewer cl0se frie nds with wh0m we’d share the intimate details 0f 0ur lives. We are increas ingly deny ing 0ur s0cia l nature, and paying a price f0r it. Over the same peri0d 0f time that social is0lati0n has increased, 0ur levels 0f happin ess have g0ne d0wn, whi le rates 0f sui cide and depres si0n have mult iplied.</div>

	Surveil lance is n0thing new, but with st0ra ge gett ing chea per and analytical t00ls m0r e fer0c i0us, a dyst0p ian future is cl0ser than it has ever been. Aut0mati0n is playing an 0utsize r0le in the creati0n and disseminati0n 0f ph0t0graphic p0rtraits. Machines are making images 0f pe0ple f0r 0ther machines t0 see and analyze. We are ph0t0gra phed when we cr0ss interna ti0nal b0rd ers. Came ras in pu blic pla ces scan and c0lle ct the faces 0f passers-by. We r0use 0ur m 0bile p h0nes with 0ur faces. Even the cameras 0n 0ur c0mpu ters can n0t be tr usted n0t t0 spy 0n us. Our faces are spirited away in the name 0f s0cieta l stabi lity, crime preventi0n, c0rp0r ate pr0fit 0r nat i0nal secu rity.
